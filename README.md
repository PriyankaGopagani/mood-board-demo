# Mini Mood Board

## Overview
A simple single-page web app that generates a mini mood board of five random color blocks every time the page loads. Each block displays its HEX color code beneath it. You can also generate a new set with the "New Colors" button or press the N key, and click any HEX code to copy it.

## Setup
